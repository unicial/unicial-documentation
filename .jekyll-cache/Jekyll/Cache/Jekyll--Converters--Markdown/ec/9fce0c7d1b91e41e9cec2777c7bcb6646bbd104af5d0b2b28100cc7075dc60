<p>The Decentraland DAO owns several of the most critical smart contracts of the Decentraland platform. They are listed below:</p>

<h2 id="the-land-contract-ï¸">The LAND contract â›°ï¸</h2>
<p>The DAO is the owner of the LAND smart contract. This means that any changes or modifications to that contract must be carried out by the DAO and the SAB.</p>

<h2 id="the-estate-contract-ï¸">The Estate contract ğŸ˜ï¸</h2>
<p>Like the LAND contract, the DAO owns the Estate contract which can only be modified by the SAB, after approval has been given by the DAO through a community vote.</p>

<h2 id="pois">POIsğŸ“</h2>
<p>The list of Points of Interest (notable locations in Decentraland that are advertised to users as good places to begin exploring the virtual world) is also owned by the DAO. This list is stored on a contract and can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.</p>

<h2 id="names-ï¸">Names ğŸ·ï¸</h2>
<p>The contracts used to mint the NFTs for unique avatar names in Decentraland are owned and controlled by the DAO. Any changes to the names contract must be approved by the DAO.</p>

<h2 id="banned-names-">Banned names ğŸš«</h2>
<p>The list of names that have been banned from the Decentraland client is stored in a contract owned by the DAO. This list can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.</p>

<h2 id="catalyst-nodes-">Catalyst nodes ğŸŒ</h2>
<p>The list of Catalyst nodes that serve content and establish the peer-to-peer connections needed to keep Decentralandâ€™s virtual world running is also owned and controlled by the DAO. This list is stored on a contract and can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.</p>

<h2 id="wearable-collections-">Wearable collections ğŸ‘•</h2>
<p>In Decentraland wearables can be grouped into collections before minting. The contracts used to manage wearables collections are owned and controlled by the DAO.</p>

<h2 id="marketplace-contracts-">Marketplace contracts ğŸ›’</h2>
<p>The Decentraland Marketplace dApp makes use of several smart contracts to manage the process of selling and bidding on LAND, Estates, and other NFTs. These contracts are also where the marketplace fees are defined, and can only be changed with the DAOs approval.</p>

<h2 id="grants-">Grants ğŸ’°</h2>
<p>The vesting contracts used to make recurring payments as part of the DAOâ€™s grant framework are also owned by the DAO. These contracts are created by the DAO Committee on behalf of the DAO, and are overseen by the SAB to prevent any risk of monetary loss due to vulnerabilities or mistakes made by the Committee.</p>
